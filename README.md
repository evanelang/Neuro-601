# Neuro-601

## Project Definition

## Project Mission
For neuromorphic researchers, who want to study how to implement and research new neuromorphic algorithms.  The NeuroFPGA is a neuromorphic piece of hardware that allows a lower barrier for entry than using an enterprise hardware unlike Intelâ€™s Loihi, IBM TrueNorth and spikeNNar. Our product is implemented on a standard FPGA which is cheaper and more easily obtainable.
