# Neuro-601

## Project Definition
A simulated neuromorphic processor on low cost consumer grade FPGA hardware for studying neuromorphic algorithms.

## Project Mission
For neuromorphic researchers, who want to study how to implement and research new neuromorphic algorithms.  The NeuroFPGA is a neuromorphic piece of hardware that allows a lower barrier for entry than using an enterprise hardware unlike Intelâ€™s Loihi, IBM TrueNorth and spikeNNar. Our product is implemented on a standard FPGA which is cheaper and more easily obtainable.

## User Stories
User Story #1:

The Card:
  
  As a machine learning researcher, I want to utilize neuromorphic computing architectures for processing data, so that I can improve energy efficiency and performance.
  
The Conversation:
  
  The development team discusses details with the machine learning researcher like:
    1.) What kind of data will be processed?
    2.) How much data does the researcher want to process at once?
    3.) How much energy efficiency improvement is expected?

The Confirmation:
  
  If the team can have:
    1.) The product demonstrates a reduction in energy consumption.
    2.) The product can process a lot of data efficiently.
    3.) The product can process a wide variety of different types of data.
  then the user story is complete.
